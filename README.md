# Interactive Web Design with Javascript

1. **Interactive To-Do List Application**
   - **Objective:** Create a simple to-do list app where users can add new tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Use DOM manipulation to create, update, and delete list items.
     - Attach event listeners for adding tasks and toggling their completion status.
     - Optionally store tasks in an array (or even in `localStorage` for persistence).
2. **Simple Calculator**
   - **Objective:** Build a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Create number and operator buttons in HTML.
     - Use JavaScript to capture user input and perform calculations.
     - Update the display dynamically as the user interacts with the calculator.
3. **Image Gallery Lightbox**
   - **Objective:** Develop an image gallery where clicking a thumbnail opens a larger version in a modal/lightbox overlay.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Use event listeners to detect when a thumbnail is clicked.
     - Dynamically update the modal content with the selected image.
     - Toggle CSS classes to show/hide the modal and add transitions for smooth effects.
4. **Weather App with API Integration**
   - **Objective:** Create a weather app that fetches and displays weather information based on a city name input.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Use the Fetch API to retrieve weather data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
     - Parse the JSON response and update the DOM with temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
     - Implement error handling for invalid input or failed network requests.
5. **Dynamic Quiz Application**
   - **Objective:** Build a quiz app that dynamically loads questions and tracks user scores.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Store quiz questions and options in a JavaScript object or load them from an external JSON file.
     - Use event listeners to capture user selections and move through quiz questions.
     - Calculate and display the final score, providing feedback or explanations as needed.
6. **Drag and Drop List Reordering**
   - **Objective:** Implement a list that allows users to reorder items using drag and drop functionality.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Leverage the HTML5 Drag and Drop API to manage drag events.
     - Update the DOM to reflect the new order of items after a drop.
     - Provide visual feedback during drag operations (e.g., highlight potential drop targets).
7. **Real-time Chat Simulation**
   - **Objective:** Develop a chat interface that simulates real-time messaging without a backend.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Create a chat window that displays messages as they are sent.
     - Use `setTimeout` or `setInterval` to simulate incoming messages.
     - Handle user input, display timestamps, and update the conversation dynamically.
8. **Single-Page Application (SPA) with Hash-based Routing**
   - **Objective:** Build a basic SPA that navigates between different views without reloading the page.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Implement hash-based routing by listening to the `window.onhashchange` event.
     - Dynamically load different content sections based on the current URL hash.
     - Maintain a consistent UI and state across route changes.
9. **Infinite Scrolling Content Loader**
   - **Objective:** Create a web page that loads additional content as the user scrolls toward the bottom.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Detect when the user is near the bottom of the page using the scroll event.
     - Use the Fetch API to load more data asynchronously (simulate with dummy data or an API).
     - Append new content to the page while ensuring smooth performance and user experience.
10. **Full-featured eCommerce Shopping Cart**
    - **Objective:** Build a comprehensive eCommerce simulation that includes product listings, a shopping cart, and dynamic price calculations.
    - **Requirements:**
      - **Product Listing:** Dynamically load and display product information (images, prices, descriptions) from a data source.
      - **Shopping Cart:** Implement add-to-cart functionality, allowing users to adjust quantities and remove items.
      - **State Management:** Use JavaScript to manage cart state and persist data using techniques like `localStorage`.
      - **Price Calculations:** Dynamically compute totals, taxes, and discounts based on cart contents.
      - **Product Filtering/Search:** Add features for filtering products by category or searching by keywords.
      - **Responsive UI:** Ensure the interface adapts well to various screen sizes and devices.
      - **Advanced Concepts:** Incorporate modular JavaScript (using ES6 modules), advanced error handling, and efficient DOM manipulation techniques.
